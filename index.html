      My name is Luka and I live in Berlin, Germany. I am a law graduate with a new career as a self-taught botanist. I hope you will enjoy my <strong>terrarium kit</strong> and that you will find your inner peace while creating one. <a href="https://planetglobula.herokuapp.com/">Visit my website</a>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      My first encounter with a closed terrarium occurred in 2013 at the school where I worked as a secretary. It was love at first sight. Only three years after IÂ´m starting to work more intensely on my project.
      At the moment I'm exploring the world of bookbinding and papercraft so you can definitely expect more new stuff from us in the future.
